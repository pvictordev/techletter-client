# Tech Letter Client

This project is a client application of the Tech Letter platform.

## Stack

- **Vue 3**: Framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.
- **Pinia**: A state management library for Vue.js.
- **PrimeVue**: A comprehensive UI component library for Vue.js, offering a wide range of components and themes to enhance the user interface.

## What I Learned

### Composition API & Options API

- **Composition API**: Introduced the Composition API, which allows for more flexible and reusable logic by using functions like `setup()`, `ref()`, and `reactive()`.
- **Options API**: Compared the Composition API with the traditional Options API, which uses options like `data`, `methods`, and `computed` to define component logic.

### Conditional Rendering using Directives

- **Directives**: Gained experience in using directives such as `v-if`, `v-else-if`, and `v-else` for conditional rendering of content in the template.
- **Event Handling**: Learned to use the `v-on` directive to listen for and handle DOM events.
- **Data Binding**: Learned to use `v-bind` for dynamic attribute binding and `v-model` for two-way data binding in forms.

### Reactive Values: `ref()` & `reactive()`

- **`ref()`**: Understood the purpose and use case of `ref()` for creating reactive primitives that can be used in the template and component logic.
- **`reactive()`**: Learned about `reactive()` for creating reactive objects.

### `computed()` Function

- **Computed Properties**: Learned about the `computed()` function to create computed properties that depend on reactive state.

### Lifecycle Hooks

- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Learned about Vue's lifecycle hooks such as `onMounted()`, `onUpdated()`, and `onUnmounted()` to run code at specific points in a component's lifecycle.

### Vue Router

- **Routing**: Learned to use Vue Router to manage navigation and routing between different views or pages within a SPA.

### Pinia State Management

- **Pinia Basics**: Learned basic of Pinia for state management, including creating stores, managing state across the application.

### PrimeVue & Vue Icon Library

- **PrimeVue Components**: Used PrimeVue components like toast notifications, dialogs, and various UI elements to enhance the application's user interface.
- **Vue Icons**: Implemented icons from Vue Icon Libraries to add visual elements and improve the overall design and usability of the application.
